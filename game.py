    ### RULES ###
    # The game is played on an 8x8 board, with 14 cities spread throughout.

    # Cities start out neutral (0) but can be taken over
    # At the beginning, the top left corner is controlled by Black and the bottom right by White

    # The game has 7 types of pieces. These are encoded as Â±1-7, with positive being White and negative being Black
    # Each piece has several important statistics, listed below as a tuple (M, A, R, C):
    # M - Maximum Health
    # A - Attack Damage
    # R - Retaliation Damage
    # C - Cost

    # The Pieces are
    # 1 - Basic     - (2, 1, 1, 1) - No special abilities
    # 2 - Runner    - (1, 1, 0, 1) - Can move twice before attacking
    # 3 - Defender  - (3, 1, 3, 2) - When killed, the attacker takes one damage (unless ranged attack)
    # 4 - Swordsman - (3, 2, 1, 3) - No special abilities
    # 5 - Archer    - (2, 1, 0, 3) - Can attack two spaces away if it has no enemy neighbor in that direction
    # 6 - Support   - (2, 0, 1, 2) - Can bless an ally to give them +R and ignore next instance of damage
    # 7 - Berserker - (3, 2, 0, 4) - Can attack again after killing an enemy

    # Command Phase:
    # (Note: Adjacency is always defined to be the 8 spaces orthogonally or diagonally next to yours, like a chess king)
    # - At the beginning of a player's turn, all of their pieces get set to one point of move readiness and one point of
    #   attack readiness
    # - A piece may spend a point of move readiness to move one space into an adjacent unoccupied space
    # - If a piece is adjacent to an enemy piece, it may forfeit all of its move readiness and spend one point of
    #   attack readiness to attack the neighboring enemy piece (known as the victim)
    # - The victim of an attack loses health equal to the attacker's A value.
    # - If the victim is reduced to 0 health, it dies, and the attacker moves into the space previously occupied by the
    #   victim
    # - If the victim is not reduced to 0 health, the victim deals retaliation damage, causing the attacker to lose
    #   health equal to the victim's R value.
    # - If this reduces the attacker to 0 health, the attacker is taken off the board.

    # Special Rules:
    # - The Runner starts its turn with two points of move readiness. Each of these two moves must be made into an
    #   unoccupied space and both are forfeited when it attacks.
    # - When a unit kills a Defender, it takes one point of retaliation damage before moving to enter the Defender's
    #   previous position. This may kill the attacking unit, in which case both the Defender and the attacking unit are
    #   taken off the board
    # - When an Archer chooses which direction to attack in, if there is an adjacent enemy in that direction, the attack
    #   happens as normal. However, if the adjacent space in that direction is empty or contains an ally, and the next
    #   space after in that direction contains an enemy, the Archer performs a ranged attack. The victim loses health
    #   equal to the Archer's A value, and, whether this kills them or not, the Archer neither moves nor takes
    #   retaliation damage
    # - When a Support blesses a unit, it remains blessed until the next time it would lose health. When a blessed unit
    #   attacks another unit, if the victim would deal retaliation damage, the blessed unit instead takes no damage and
    #   stops being blessed. When a blessed unit is attacked, it loses no health, retaliates as though it had an R value
    #   one greater than it does, and then stops being blessed.
    # - When a Berserker attacks and kills an enemy unit, it gains one point of attack readiness. This can immediately
    #   be spent to attack another unit from its new position

    # Civilization Phase:
    # - Once the player cannot or does not want to move more pieces, they get a Civilization Phase. During this phase,
    #   the player can either take the Research or Economy action.
    # - Research: The player may research one new unit type among the ones they do not yet know how to make. Until the
    #   end of the game, they will be able to produce this unit in addition to the Basic unit and any other units they
    #   may have researched.
    # - Economy: The player gains money equal to the number of cities they control on the board. Then, they can spend
    #   money to place new units on unoccupied cities under their control. The total cost of the units placed is
    #   deducted from their money total, and any remainder is kept for the future.

    # After the Civilization Phase, the player's turn ends and the other player takes their turn.

    ### IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ###
    # - The positions on the board are designated both by a tuple numbering their position in the array, and as a
    #   two-character square name like how squares are named in chess. The correspondence is as follows:
    #   - The Top Left corner of the map is (0,0) or "A8"
    #   - The Top Right corner of the map is (0,7) or "H8"
    #   - The Bottom Left corner of the map is (7,0) or "A1"
    #   - The Bottom Right corner of the map is (7,7) or "H1"
